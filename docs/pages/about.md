# **About Me**

Hi there! I am **Wesley** :wave:,<br>
I'm a computer engineer student at [Insper](https://www.insper.edu.br/en/), graduating at December 2021. Winning a full scholarship for both high school and university has reassured me of how essential and life changing quality educaiton is. Switching between first and second in class, I also focus on all the extracurricular activities and homemade projects the 24h of a day can fit and give my best to honor those who believe in my potential.
