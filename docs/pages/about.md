# **About Me**

Hi there! I am **Wesley** :wave:,<br>
I'm a computer engineer turned data scientist. 
My biggest interest revolves around simplifying our day to day lives through technology and AI (even before the hype). 

Besides that, winning a full scholarship for both high school and university has reassured me of how essential and life changing quality education is. Switching between first and second in class, I also focused on filling all the 24 hours a day has to fit all the extracurricular activities and homemade projects possible and give my best to honor those who believed in my potential.
