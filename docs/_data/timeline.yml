    At ISMART, Institution that provides scholarships for low income talented students
    I had the opportinity to study at one of the best high schools of Brasil, Colegio Marista
    Arquidiocesano, with 100% scholarship. As if it wasn't enough, there is still a personal
    development program that I'm still part of.

- title: Computer Engineering, Insper - BR

  to: present
  description: |
    With a full scholarship I joined Insper knowing I had to experience all I could. So I
    did it! I would spend all the time out of classes at the labs, trying all the tools and
    machines available, from osciloscopes to 3D printers. When the time came to use them in
    class I could already help my classmates and try more advanced experiments.
    
    Out of classes and labs, I joined VEGA Cultural, a student-run organization focused on
    bringing cultural activities to the campus, in which I took care of the finantial side 
    of contracting and renting the installations.

    From the 2nd semester until now I have been reelected as the class representative for the
    great relation with all the Faculty and university's departments while never been less
    than the 2nd in class.

    Partial scholarship for the summer Program for Capstone Design Project. Aside for the the
    understanding of design, manufacturing and the applications of solar cells and 3D modeling,
    this program was my first experience outside of Brazil. It gave me the confirmation that
    as long as I am doing what I love, which is being an engineer surrounded by briliant people,
    I will be happy wherever the country, language or currency.

    At BigData I chose the challenge to validate and analyze a space state based time series
    forecasting model for use in scarce data scenarios without having ever studied time series
    forecasting. Diving through the papers and the code written I was able to implement other
    baseline methods for comparison while also getting a performance improvement of 40% in the
    prediction runtime and doubling the size of the proxy pool used by the whole company.

    I started at BTG with the task to build an interactive dashboard for consolidating the
    risk and origin of incomplete finantial operations. Finishing before the deadline, I
    was able to integrate a MQ service with the internal SQL database, giving the Operations
    area data they had never been able to get on time.

    I joined Dolado as a javascript backend developer, implementing routes for the company's
    marketplace. The number of customers was increasing and during meetings we saw the need
    to better understand what was the experience we were giving them. I joined the senior developer
    two weeks after starting on my position. After two more weeks, with the results and
    ideas I brought I was assigned to the leadership role of the Data squad, building the
    infrastructure to gather, store and analyze all the user data needed to understand out customer.
